# ChangeRobloxFont
A little script that I wrote in python 3.7.4 that runs a code that replaces the font automatically.
I mainly made it for Phantom Forces, but you can use every font used within the roblox directory.
Alternatively, you can also change it for Phantom Forces first, as the program will create a backup of Roblox's original font

# Requirements
A windows operating system, MacOs or Linux may not work

# Current Errors
Error code 480 (description unknown at this point, halting a fix.)

# Download the correct version at:
https://github.com/TheAimMeister/ChangeRobloxFont/releases

# How to use:
1. Download a font

2. Place the font(s) and the .exe in a directory

3. Check if the fonts names are, and if not rename them to:
   - arial.ttf
   - arialdb.ttf
   - SourceSansPro-Bold.ttf
   - SourceSansPro-Light.ttf
   - SourceSansPro-Regular.ttf

3.1 If the font consists of only one .ttf file,
        create copies and rename them to the names listed at step 3

4. Run the .exe
